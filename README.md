# Personal Portfolio

## Description

This is the base of my personal portfolio for a project from the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. This portfolio was created with HTML and CSS. It is mobile responsive and has links to various subsites including: Github, LinkedIn, Phone, Email, and Resume. I am a beginner developer and scaling the site down challenged me the most for this project. In the future, I hope to revamp this portfolio with all working apps and projects, as I continue in the course.
